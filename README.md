# ESP8266 Temperature and Humidity
Monitoring Room's Temperature and Humidity with NodeMCU

## The NodeMCU
NodeMCU microboard controler that comes with WiFi included, and it costs just $2 dolars.

Here is a good explanation of what NodeMCU is: https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/iot-nodemcu-open-why-use/

# Summary
#### 1) Install IDE to communicate with the NodeMCU board.
#### 2) Write the program code
#### 3) Upload the program to the NodeMCU board
#### 4) Connect the sensor to the NodeMCU board
    
    
## 1) Installing IDE

1) Download and install the Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

2) Fill in "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field:
  http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
